Slept like a log last night  woke up in the fireplace.
Chances are if you' ve seen one shopping center, you've seen a mall.
I'll tell you what often gets over looked... garden fences.
Why did the tomato blush? Because it saw the salad dressing.
Whoever invented the knock-knock joke should get a no bell prize.
Why do birds fly south for the winter? Because it's too far to walk.
Why does a Moon-rock taste better than an Earth-rock? Because it's a little meteor.
I'll tell you what often gets over looked... garden fences.
What do you do on a remote island? Try and find the TV island it belongs to.
To be Frank, I'd have to change my name.
Did you hear about the guy whose whole left side was cut off? He's all right now.
I'll tell you what often gets over looked... garden fences.
Dad Im hungry  Hi hungry Im dad
