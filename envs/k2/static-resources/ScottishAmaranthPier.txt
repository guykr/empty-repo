Dad Im hungry  Hi hungry Im dad
Im only familiar with 25 letters in the English language. I dont know why.
I knew I shouldn't steal a mixer from work, but it was a whisk I was willing to take.
I was fired from the keyboard factory yesterday.  I wasn't putting in enough shifts.
To be Frank, I'd have to change my name.
I thought my wife was joking when she said she'd leave me if I didn't stop signing "I'm A Believer"... Then I saw her face.
Slept like a log last night  woke up in the fireplace.
